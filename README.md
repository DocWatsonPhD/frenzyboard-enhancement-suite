# Features
#### Youtube tag support
* Now you can be a cool kid and see embedded youtube videos using [yt] tags. Use the Youtube video ID itself, the full URL, or the URL from the Youtube "Share" button. Also available as a shortcut button in new topic and reply areas.

#### Post previews
* The board supports post previews again! Mouse over a post and see the first line of text. Tentatively planning to "fill in" the preview text and un-escape any apostrophes inside it, but right now that's not too important.
